# Serial LED Control

## Abstract
Logic to control WS2812/SK6812 LEDs with its custom serial interface.
Represents core implementation along with some common bus interfaces, like WB or AXI.
Supports 32/24 bit variants over generics/parameters.

## Status
Still WIP, but  
 - Core described in Verilog  
 - Core described in VHDL   
 - Testbench behavior done in VHDL
